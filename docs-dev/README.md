# docs-dev

Reference documentation for contributors and coding agents working _on_ this library: why the code
is the way it is, and what is left to do. It is internal: the published site (`docs/`) is built
for people _using_ the library, and nothing here is copied into it.

| Folder                                  | Holds                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [architecture/](architecture/README.md) | **Why** the code is the way it is: design choices, rejected alternatives, trade-offs, invariants, vocabulary, source map. The single source of truth for rationale — docstrings must not repeat it. |
| [todo/](todo/README.md)                 | **What is left to do**: bugs, desirable features, refactors, and questions for the maintainer. The place to file drive-by findings instead of silently fixing or forgetting them.                   |

The two are complements: a ticket describes work; closing it usually leaves a decision, and
the decision belongs in `architecture/`.

Start at [architecture/README.md](architecture/README.md) — it carries the reading guide that
maps source modules to documents, so you can open only what your change touches.

## Where things go

| What you have                                                        | Where it goes                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| A contract: arguments, return value, errors, footguns, an example    | The docstring                                |
| A pointer from a function to the rationale behind it                 | A `Dev Notes:` section in its docstring      |
| A reason, a trade-off, a rejected alternative, an invariant          | `architecture/`                              |
| Something broken, missing, or ugly that you are not fixing right now | `todo/`                                      |
| A question only the maintainer can answer                            | `todo/questions/`                            |
| Anything a _user_ of this library needs                              | `README.md`, `docs/`, `examples/`            |
| A standing instruction to coding agents                              | `AGENTS.md`, or the protocol folder it names |

## Reference here, protocol elsewhere

These folders describe the project; they do not tell anyone how to work on it. The step
protocols — read order, docstring conventions, test-first bug fixing, how to file and close a
ticket — live in their own folder, which `AGENTS.md` points to. Nothing here links to it: this
documentation has to stand on its own for any reader, and instructions written for one class of
reader would make it depend on them.

## Agent instructions: one file, `AGENTS.md`

`AGENTS.md` holds the standing instructions for every coding agent. `CLAUDE.md` is a single
`@AGENTS.md` line — a Claude Code [memory import](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory),
expanded into context at session start, so Claude reads exactly what other agents read.
Never edit `CLAUDE.md`; edit `AGENTS.md`.

Two hand-maintained copies is what this replaces: they drift, and because both files are
`.gitignore`d, no CI check could ever catch it. A symlink would work too, but
creating one on Windows needs Administrator privileges or Developer Mode, and this project is
developed on Windows. Claude-specific instructions, should any ever be needed, go _below_ the
import line in `CLAUDE.md`.

Only what an agent needs in _every_ session stays in `AGENTS.md`; a protocol that matters for
one kind of task is loaded from the protocol folder when that task comes up.
